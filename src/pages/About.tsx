        <h1>About Recovery Dharma Costa Mesa</h1>

        <p>
          My name is <strong>Maher</strong>, and I’m one of the original facilitators of the Recovery Dharma Costa Mesa
          group. Our journey began during my time in treatment at <em>Barn Life</em>, where I connected with friends
          also seeking healing and transformation.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of our friends had started a Refuge Recovery meeting and introduced us to the idea. From there, we
          discovered{' '}
          <a href="https://recoverydharma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Recovery Dharma
          </a>{' '}
          — a Buddhist-inspired approach to recovery that deeply resonated with us.
        </p>

        <p>
          I shared the idea with others at Barn Life, and they were excited about hosting a Recovery Dharma meeting
          on-site. Using the resources and guidance provided by the Recovery Dharma community, we began holding weekly
          meetings that quickly grew in depth and connection.
        </p>

        <p>
          We enjoyed a beautiful season of gathering together at Barn Life. Eventually, I found myself holding the space
          alone for a while, and when I asked for support, the community responded with open hearts — and the group
          began to grow once more.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our meetings were later relocated to a new home, and today, we are honored to hold space at the{' '}
          <strong>Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple</strong> in Costa Mesa — a peaceful and welcoming environment for our
          sangha.
        </p>

        <p>
          The group is now held regularly with the support of compassionate facilitators, including{' '}
          <strong>Tommy</strong>, <strong>Andrea</strong>, and <strong>Nick</strong>, who bring their own wisdom,
          presence, and kindness to our meetings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recovery Dharma Costa Mesa is grounded in meditation, self-inquiry, shared wisdom, and a strong sense of
          community. Everyone is welcome — wherever you are on your journey, know that you are not alone.
